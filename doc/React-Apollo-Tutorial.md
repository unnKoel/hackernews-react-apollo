  community-driven, acceptable in every major development platform, has features like caching, /Users/numbersics/programme/front-end/mywork/netlify-feature-touroptimistic UI, subscription support and more.

- Relay
  Facebook offical, performance benefits but at the cost of a notable learning curve

- urql
  highly focused on React, focuses on simplicity and extensibility, Together with the first-party exchange `@urql/exchange-graphcache` it is basically equivalent in functionality with Apollo
